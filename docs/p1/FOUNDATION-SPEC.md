# P1 — Frontend Foundation Spec

**Status:** Approved (owner decisions and corrections folded in, 2026-09-10).
**Parent:** [`../PERSONAL-WORLD-COMPLETION-PLAN.md`](../PERSONAL-WORLD-COMPLETION-PLAN.md) Phase P1.
**Gate:** P1 implementation does not start until the owner confirms P0.1
credential rotation, `main` is pushed, and CI is green for that exact SHA.

This is a bounded implementation contract. Tasks in §10 are sized for a
cheaper implementation model working against this document; a FABLE-class
review is required only where marked. No further design iteration is
expected unless implementation produces concrete evidence that contradicts
this spec — in that case, stop and record the evidence.

Settled decisions this spec obeys (do not reopen): React 19 + Vite ·
Tailwind may assist but never owns design truth · no client-side bearer
secret · `getAuthToken()`/`localStorage` is transitional until P2 ·
tracked repo holds examples/defaults, never the owner's runtime state ·
contextual chat is the target, standalone Chat is a parity/optional
destination · no Storybook (or React Query — §1.4) unless a bounded task
proves it removes more complexity than it adds · Vitest + Playwright + axe
+ token drift + bundle/secret checks are the baseline · no fake data
survives parity · no external fonts · accessibility contracts are
authoritative.

## 1. Ownership boundary

```text
design/tokens.json ──gen──► frontend/src/tokens.css   (only file where hex may appear)
docs/accessibility/*  ─────► primitive contracts (§5) ──► frontend/src/primitives/*
src/personal_world/api.py ► /api/*   truth, auth, prefs floor, sections
                          ► /        SPA index + fallback ─► frontend/dist  (React owns all pixels)
                          ► /fonts/* /companions/* /icons/sprite.svg   (existing routes, kept)
```

### 1.1 Backend owns
Truth, authentication, the preference floor (400s), the sections registry
and its persistence, serving of `dist/`, fonts, companion art, icon sprite.

### 1.2 Frontend owns
Rendering, routing, primitives, small explicit client caches. It holds
**no truth**: `localStorage["pw_prefs"]` is deleted; preferences come from
`GET /api/prefs` and are applied to `<html data-pw-*>` before content
paints.

### 1.3 Directory and serving
- `frontend-v2/` → `frontend/` (git mv of source only; `dist/`,
  `node_modules/`, `.env*` never tracked — enforced by `.gitignore` and
  `tests/test_public_safety.py`).
- `PW_FRONTEND` = `legacy` (default **during** P1) | `react`.
  `PW_FRONTEND_DIST` overrides the dist path (dev default
  `<package>/../../frontend/dist`; image default `/app/frontend/dist`).
- React mode: `GET /` and any non-`/api`, non-asset GET → `index.html`;
  `/assets/*` served with immutable cache headers. Dist missing → **503**
  HTML "Personal World's interface is not built" (honest state, not a
  crash). `index.html` never embeds a token, principal, or prefs — the
  app fetches them.
- The parity commit (T15) flips the default to `react`, deletes
  `DASHBOARD_HTML`, `SETUP_HTML`, `WIZARD_HTML`, `LOGIN_HTML`, the
  server routes `/setup`, `/setup-wizard`, `/login`, and the `legacy`
  value.
- Dockerfile: stage 1 `node:22-alpine` (`npm ci && npm run build`);
  stage 2 = existing python image, `COPY --from=frontend /build/dist
  /app/frontend/dist`, `ENV PW_FRONTEND=react` (set in T15).
- Router basename `/`; `vite.config.ts` `base: "/"`; dev proxy `/api`,
  `/healthz`, `/fonts`, `/companions`, `/icons` → `:8000`.

### 1.4 Lean dependencies (owner correction)
Foundation = React, react-dom, react-router-dom, Tailwind v4 (+vite
plugin), `clsx`. Test = Vitest, `vitest-axe`, Playwright,
`@axe-core/playwright`. **Removed:** Storybook and every `@storybook/*`,
Chromatic, `@tanstack/react-query`, `class-variance-authority`,
`tailwind-merge`, `lucide-react` (sprite is the icon system), template
cruft. `oxlint` stays only if `npm run lint` is wired into CI in T4;
otherwise removed.

Data access = one typed fetch client (§1.5) + ordinary hooks. A tiny
`lib/cache.ts` (`Map` keyed by URL, TTL, `invalidate(prefix)`) may be
added only where a screen demonstrably re-fetches the same resource. Any
later proposal to add React Query (or similar) must be a bounded task
whose report shows removed complexity (dedupe/invalidation/retry code
deleted) exceeding the added surface.

### 1.5 Transitional auth (until P2)
`/login` React route; token in `localStorage["pw_token"]` (legacy key, so
existing browsers keep working); one `getAuthToken()` in `lib/api.ts`;
`401` → `/login`; `503` with `auth_configured=false` → `/setup`. Writes
send `X-PW-StepUp: 1` exactly as the legacy dashboard does, through a
single `stepUp()` helper so P2 removes it in one place. **No
`import.meta.env` value may ever be a credential** — the only permitted
key is `VITE_API_URL`; P0.7's scanner and a `dist/` scan enforce it.

---

## 2. Sections

### 2.1 Registry (tracked code — defaults, never the owner's state)
`src/personal_world/sections.py`:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SectionSpec:
    id: str
    label: str
    icon: str                         # sprite symbol id (must exist in icons/manifest.json)
    default_order: int
    default_visible: bool = True
    pinned: bool = False              # cannot be hidden; may be reordered
    kind: Literal["core", "transitional", "extension"] = "core"
    capabilities: tuple[str, ...] = ()  # informs `configured`/`status`; never hides

SECTIONS = (
  SectionSpec("today",     "Today",            "navigation--today",    0),
  SectionSpec("interests", "Interests",        "navigation--discover", 1, capabilities=("discovery",)),
  SectionSpec("media",     "Media",            "navigation--media",    2, capabilities=("media",)),
  SectionSpec("projects",  "Projects",         "navigation--projects", 3, capabilities=("source_control",)),
  SectionSpec("lab",       "Lab",              "navigation--lab",      4, capabilities=("homelab_health",)),
  SectionSpec("journal",   "Journal & Memory", "navigation--journal",  5, capabilities=("journal",)),
  SectionSpec("vault",     "Vault",            "navigation--vault",    6, capabilities=("secrets",)),
  SectionSpec("chat",      "Chat",             "navigation--chat",     7, kind="transitional",
                                                                          capabilities=("reasoning",)),
  SectionSpec("settings",  "Settings",         "navigation--settings", 8, pinned=True),
)
```

**Pinning (owner decision 1):** only `settings` is pinned — it is the
recovery/configuration surface and must always be reachable. `today` is
visible by default and strongly preferred but may be hidden or reordered
like any other user-facing section. Settings exposes an obvious
**"Restore default sections"** action (`PUT {"order": [], "hidden": []}`).
Nothing may ever make every section hideable such that the recovery path
disappears; the pinned rule is enforced server-side (400).

Icon ids are checked against `design/assets/icons/manifest.json` by a
test. If a name is missing, T1 substitutes the closest existing glyph and
records the substitution in its report — no new artwork in P1.

### 2.2 Persistence (private runtime, per person)
New pydantic field `World.layout: dict[str, Any] = {}` (additive; schema
version unchanged; `init.py` untouched). Stored as
`layout["sections"] = {"schema": "personal-world/sections/1",
"order": [ids], "hidden": [ids]}` in the caller's `world.json` via the
existing `_user_paths()` (single: `data/world.json`; multi:
`data/users/<id>/world.json`). Classification `world` (in `world-export`,
never in `settings-export`). Never in tracked `config/`.

### 2.3 `GET /api/sections` — `require_auth`, persons only
```json
{"ok": true, "data": {"schema": "personal-world/sections/1", "sections": [
  {"id": "today", "label": "Today", "icon": "navigation--today", "order": 0,
   "visible": true, "pinned": false, "kind": "core",
   "configured": true, "status": null},
  {"id": "media", "label": "Media", "icon": "navigation--media", "order": 2,
   "visible": true, "pinned": false, "kind": "core",
   "configured": false, "status": "not_configured"},
  {"id": "lab", "label": "Lab", "icon": "navigation--lab", "order": 4,
   "visible": true, "pinned": false, "kind": "core",
   "configured": true, "status": "unavailable"}
]}}
```

Merge rule: start from stored `order`; drop unknown ids; append registry
ids missing from `order` in `default_order`; `visible = id not in hidden`
(pinned ⇒ always `true`; `default_visible=False` ⇒ hidden until the user
shows it).

**Status vocabulary (owner correction 1 and 2):** `status.py` owns the
closed vocabulary. For a section with **no** capability dependency,
`status` is `null` — never an invented value such as `"n/a"`. For
sections with dependencies, `status` = the worst canonical status among
their capabilities from `registry.status_map()`.
`configured = status is null or status not in {"not_configured",
"disabled"}`. `configured` answers "is something wired up?"; `status`
answers "how is it doing?". Neither affects navigability: a failing or
unconfigured provider **never** removes a section; the route renders an
honest `EmptyState`/`ErrorState`. `StatusChip` receives only canonical
statuses; a `null` status renders no chip.

### 2.4 `PUT /api/sections` — `require_step_up`, persons only
Body `{"order": [...], "hidden": [...]}` — either key optional (omitted
keeps stored). Validation errors are collected and returned together as
one `400`: unknown id; duplicate in `order`; pinned id in `hidden`;
non-list values. Journals `SETTINGS_CHANGE "sections layout updated"`.
Returns the `GET` shape. `{"order": [], "hidden": []}` resets to defaults.

### 2.5 `GET /api/prefs/schema` — `require_auth`
Read-only: `{key: {type, default, floor, allowed}}` derived from
`prefs.PREFS`, so Settings can never offer a value the server rejects.

---

## 3. Preferences: motion vocabulary (owner decision 2)

`prefs.py`: `MOTION = EnumPref(key="motion", default="reduced",
allowed=("off", "reduced", "subtle"), floor="off", ...)` — ordered most→
least restrictive so the index-based floor admits all three.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `off` | No nonessential animation. No ambient/idle movement. No decorative pose transitions. State changes remain understandable without motion. |
| `reduced` (**default**) | No continuous/ambient animation. Immediate or effectively instant state/pose changes allowed. No motion required to understand state. |
| `subtle` | Opt-in only. Transitions ≤300ms. Ambient movement ≤2px where allowed. No pulse/spin/shake/flash. Never required for meaning. |

CSS emission (`prefs_style_block` + `tokens.css`):
`--pw-motion-duration` = `0ms` (off, reduced) / `200ms` (subtle);
`--pw-motion-ambient` = `0` (off, reduced) / `1` (subtle);
`[data-pw-motion="off"]` additionally disables pose *transitions* (poses
switch instantly, no crossfade) — the distinction from `reduced` is that
`reduced` may still snap between poses while `off` shows a single static
pose. **Unconditionally:** `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { *
{ animation: none !important; transition: none !important } }` and
`--pw-motion-ambient: 0` — the OS setting overrides any application
preference and suppresses subtle animation.

`docs/accessibility/PREFERENCES_SCHEMA.json` is reconciled to exactly
this vocabulary and these definitions; a test asserts schema values ==
`prefs.py` allowed values. A CSS lint test over `frontend/src/**/*.css`
and `tokens.css` fails on `infinite`, `spin`, `pulse`, `ping`, `shake`,
`flash`, or any duration `> 300ms`.

---

## 4. Token generation

- `frontend/scripts/gen-tokens.mjs` (no dependencies): `design/tokens.json`
  → `frontend/src/tokens.css`. `color."surface.canvas"` →
  `--pw-color-surface-canvas`; `light.*` under `[data-pw-theme="light"]`
  and `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)` when no explicit theme;
  `targets.*` → `--pw-target-minimum` / `--pw-target-large`; `spacing.*`,
  `typography.*`; `focus.ring` → `--pw-focus-ring`.
- **Design-truth correction (one line, cite A11y §2.4):** `tokens.json`
  `focus.ring` currently references `text.primary`; the contract and the
  legacy CSS use `accent.primary` (teal) in comfortable mode and white in
  high contrast. T3 changes `focus.ring` to `"2px solid accent.primary,
  offset 2px"` and adds `focus.ring_high_contrast: "2px solid #FFFFFF,
  offset 2px"`.
- Generated file is committed; `npm run tokens:check` regenerates to
  memory and diffs → CI fails on drift.
- Tailwind v4 `@theme` **only** aliases `--pw-*` variables; no literal
  colors in config or classes (`bg-[#…]` fails the hex test).
- Hex/`rgb(` literal test over `frontend/src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}` and
  `index.html`: only `tokens.css` may match.
- Status tints: none exist in `tokens.json` (luminance-only rule).
  `frontend-v2`'s `--color-ok/warn/err` and saturated badge variants are
  removed. If P13 wants status tints they enter `tokens.json` first.
- Fonts: `@font-face` for Instrument Sans and Young Serif pointing at the
  existing `/fonts/*` route; Google Fonts `<link>` removed; Playwright
  asserts zero cross-origin requests.

---

## 5. Primitive contracts (`frontend/src/primitives/`)

Common rules: TypeScript strict; no hex; interactive targets
`min-height/min-width: var(--pw-target-size)`; focus ring `2px solid
var(--pw-focus-ring)`, offset 2px; each primitive ships a Vitest file with
an axe run and keyboard tests; no primitive announces companion state.

| Primitive | Semantics and behavior | Props (minimum) | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dialog** | Native `<dialog>` via `showModal()`. Focus trapped by the platform; initial focus on the **safe** action (default Cancel); `Escape` = cancel; explicit close button named "Close <title>"; `aria-labelledby` = title `h2`, `aria-describedby` = body; focus returns to the invoker on close; background inert. `danger` variant: confirm label is the verb; body names consequence and provider (A11y §4.4). | `open, title, description?, onCancel, onConfirm?, confirmLabel, danger?, initialFocus: "cancel"\|"confirm"` | render `div` modals; use OK/Yes/Proceed; autofocus the destructive action |
| **Drawer** | Non-modal `<aside role="complementary" aria-labelledby>`; on open focus moves to its heading; `Escape` closes and focus returns to the trigger; background stays interactive. Below 600px it becomes a modal bottom sheet (composes Dialog) per A11y §3.5. Hosts provenance/detail and the World Assistant (heading "World Assistant"). | `open, title, onClose, side: "right"\|"bottom", children` | trap focus on desktop; steal focus on content refresh |
| **Popover** | Native `popover="auto"` + `popovertarget`; trigger carries `aria-expanded`; light-dismiss and `Escape`; focus returns to trigger; contents are ≥44px targets. Menus and small pickers only. | `trigger, children, placement?` | hold destructive actions; be the only path to any function |
| **LiveRegion** | One app-level `<div role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">`. `announce(message, {key})` batches: messages inside a 30s window merge into "N updates: …" (A11y §8.3); allow-list of kinds (health change, attention resolved, action completed, error); dedupe by key. Exposed as `useAnnounce()`. | — | announce poll ticks, timestamps, provider observations, companion states |
| **StatusChip** | `<span class="chip" data-status>` containing the **status word** (canonical `status.py` vocabulary, humanized by one map) plus optional label; rank encoded by luminance only; `title` = raw status. Receives only canonical statuses; callers pass nothing for `null`. | `status, label?, size?` | encode meaning by hue; accept invented statuses |
| **Disclosure** | `<details><summary>` with `aria-controls`; levels 1–4 (glance → technical) nest; summary is a ≥44px target. `TechnicalDetails` preset = Level 4 (provider, model, latency, raw). | `summary, level, defaultOpen?, children` | hide Level-1 truth behind a click; animate beyond the motion tier |
| **CompanionSlot** (owner correction 3) | Two **sibling** parts, never nested: (a) artwork `<span aria-hidden="true"><img alt="" src="/companions/<companion>.svg"></span>`; (b) when `asAssistantTrigger`, a separate `<button>` whose only accessible name is **"Open World assistant"** — it is **not** inside any `aria-hidden` subtree. Reads the `companion` pref; sizes `micro\|nav\|inline\|empty\|error` per COMPANION_INTEGRATION. Companion off removes part (a) only; the trigger and its function remain. Poses (P13) are decorative and unannounced. | `size, pose?, asAssistantTrigger?, onOpenAssistant?` | wrap the trigger in `aria-hidden`; carry information; be focusable itself; announce |
| **StepUpPrompt** | Dialog preset explaining *why* elevation is needed and naming the action. P1 (transitional): confirm re-sends the request with `X-PW-StepUp: 1`. P2 replaces the confirm body with password/IdP re-auth **without changing the component API**. `useStepUp()` returns `withStepUp(fn)` that catches `403 step_up_required` and opens the prompt. | `action, reason, onElevated` | store or display credentials; be bypassable by "remember" |

Shell components (P1, not primitives): `AppShell` (skip link first,
`header`, `nav aria-label="Main"` rendered as rail ≥900px / banner
600–899px / bottom bar <600px with `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`,
`main#main-content`, Drawer mount), `SectionNav` (from `GET
/api/sections`; `aria-current="page"`), `EmptyState` (honest
`not_configured`/`unavailable`, names the capability and the
configuration knob, never a mount path), `ErrorState` (names what failed
and what still works — A11y §4.5), `Login`, `SetupWizard` (one flow:
token ≥8, optional vault passphrase, companion, world name).

---

## 6. Standalone Chat — transition rule

`chat` is `kind: transitional`, visible by default in P1 so parity is
provable (send, thinking status, provenance, retry, history, provider
info). Its screen is a component, `ChatPanel`, mounted in a route; **the
same component** is what the World Assistant Drawer hosts in P4 with a
context profile. No chat logic lives in the route file. After P4,
`default_visible` flips to `false`; showing/hiding is `PUT /api/sections`,
never a migration. Nav code may not assume Chat exists.

---

## 7. Parity checklist — gate to delete the legacy HTML

Every row is a Playwright test unless marked HUMAN.

| # | Legacy behavior | React proof | API |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Today: health sentence, attention, "what changed", journal composer + recent, "More from your world" (Services, Subscription usage, Capabilities) | all from real data; a quiet day shows no green list | `/api/status`, `GET /api/daily`, `/api/journal`, `/api/apps`, `/api/lab/state` |
| 2 | Services launcher + inline add (step-up) | add → appears; keyboard only | `PUT /api/apps` |
| 3 | Lab table with per-row provenance | rows + Disclosure L4; honest `not_configured` naming `PW_LAB_CLI` when absent | `/api/lab/state` |
| 4 | Journal kind filters (`aria-pressed`), load more (`n=`), provenance | same | `/api/journal?n=` |
| 5 | Vault status, unlock, **lock**, names, set, delete | all wired; values never rendered | `/api/vault/*` |
| 6 | Settings: prefs (server-validated), companion, reminders add/toggle/delete, capability table | options from `/api/prefs/schema`; server 400 shown specifically; **Sections order/visibility + "Restore default sections"** | `/api/prefs`, `/api/prefs/schema`, `/api/themes`, `/api/reminders`, `/api/sections` |
| 7 | Chat: send, thinking text, provenance, retry/keep writing, sessionStorage history, provider info | via `ChatPanel` | `/api/chat`, `/api/chat/providers` |
| 8 | Setup: token, optional vault passphrase, companion, world-name fact, login deep-link on fresh install | one wizard | `/api/setup`, `/api/world/fact`, `/api/prefs` |
| 9 | Login token entry → `/` | `/login`; `401` anywhere → `/login` | — |
| 10 | Prefs applied without flash: `data-pw-*`, `--pw-*`, 44px floor, reduced-motion query | attrs present after load; `text_scale=1.5` visibly larger | `/api/prefs` |
| 11 | Skip link first; landmarks header/nav/main/complementary; one visible `h1`; `aria-current` | axe + DOM assertions every route | — |
| 12 | Rail ≥900 / banner 600–899 / bottom bar <600; safe-area inset | screenshots; no horizontal scroll at 1440/900/600/375 | — |
| 13 | Status never color-only | DOM assertion over all `.chip` | — |
| 14 | Companion artwork `aria-hidden`; assistant trigger labelled and **outside** the hidden subtree | DOM assertion (§5 CompanionSlot) | — |
| 15 | No fabricated content (fake "Recent Changes", hard-coded providers/timezone/version/host, `/api/icons/upload`, `console.log`) | grep test over `frontend/src`; zero console errors | — |
| 16 | No external requests; no Google Fonts | request interception | — |
| 17 | Bundle ≤350 KB gzipped; zero secret shapes in `dist/`; only `VITE_API_URL` in `import.meta.env` | size test; P0.7 patterns over `dist/**` | — |
| 18 | **200% zoom / reflow (owner acceptance correction)** | Automated **proxies**: (a) `document.documentElement.style.zoom = "2"` reflow stress; (b) viewport 720×450 at 1440-layout (what 200% browser zoom yields in CSS px). Both labelled *proxy*. **HUMAN, required:** real browser zoom 200% on the deployed React build — no page-level horizontal scroll, no clipped controls, navigation operable, dialogs/drawers reachable, no overlapping/truncated essential text. Recorded in the P1 truth report; CSS zoom alone never satisfies A11y §6.4. | — |

Retired with the deletion commit (T15): `test_dashboard.py` structural
tests, `test_prefs.py::TestDashboardPrefsPlumbing`, `test_setup_wizard.py`
structure, `test_lab_panel.py::test_dashboard_wires_the_panel`,
`test_services_notes.py::test_dashboard_has_services_and_composer`,
`test_framework.py::test_dashboard_is_repo_native` (replaced by "dist is
repo-built; tokens derive from tokens.json"). Every server-side floor and
API test stays.

---

## 8. Acceptance gates (CI from P1 onward)

- `frontend` job: `npm ci` → `npm run tokens:check` → (lint if wired) →
  `npx vitest run` (primitives + axe, hex scan, motion lint, no-fake
  strings, api error mapping) → `npm run build` → gzip size assert →
  `dist/` secret scan.
- `browser` job: build image (or `uvicorn` + `dist`), `PW_API_TOKEN=
  ci-token`, complete setup via API, Playwright over every section route
  × {1440, 900, 600, 375}; `@axe-core/playwright` 0 serious/critical;
  focusable `boundingBox ≥ 44×44`; keyboard walk of nav and Settings;
  zoom proxies (§7 row 18); cross-origin requests = 0; console errors = 0.
- Existing `test`, `framework-gates`, `security-gates`, `compose` jobs
  unchanged; `public-safety` already covers tracked `frontend/` source.
- Human gate: row 18 real-zoom check plus one walk of rows 1–9 by the
  owner on the deployed build. Owner's "feels like mine" judgment is
  recorded but is P13's criterion, not P1's.

T1–T4 are independent; T10–T13 run in parallel worktrees after T9.

## 10. Bounded tasks

One worktree commit each via `scripts/safe-commit.sh`; own tests; truth
report per `AGENT_POLICY.md`. FABLE review required for T1, T3, T9, T15,
T16; the rest are GLM-autonomous against this spec.

| # | Task | Depends | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| T0 | This spec persisted; INDEX row | — | `test_docs` — **done with the approval commit** |
| T1 | `sections.py` registry; `World.layout`; `GET/PUT /api/sections` per §2 (status `null` for no-capability sections, `configured`, settings-only pin, reset); `GET /api/prefs/schema`; icon-id test | — | ≥14 API tests: merge rule, unknown/dup/pinned-hidden 400, `today` hideable, `settings` not, `null` status, `configured` vs `status` matrix, per-user in multi, journal event, reset |
| T2 | Motion `off\|reduced\|subtle` in `prefs.py`; CSS emission per §3; `PREFERENCES_SCHEMA.json` reconciled; schema-equality test; motion CSS lint test (backend side for `prefs_style_block`) | — | prefs tests updated; default stays `reduced`; OS override present unconditionally |
| T3 | `PW_FRONTEND` switch + dist serving + 503 (default `legacy`); `tokens.json` focus-ring correction; Dockerfile multi-stage build (image still boots legacy) | — | tests: legacy default byte-identical; react mode serves index; 503 honest; `/api/*` untouched; image builds in CI |
| T4 | `git mv frontend-v2 frontend`; dependency diet per §1.4 (remove Storybook, Chromatic, React Query, cva, tailwind-merge, lucide, template cruft, Google Fonts); `base:"/"`; Vitest/vitest-axe/Playwright/axe deps; scripts | T3 | `npm ci && npm run build` green; `package.json` contains none of the removed packages |
| T5 | `gen-tokens.mjs`, `tokens.css`, `tokens:check`, Tailwind `@theme` aliases, hex-literal test, `@font-face` via `/fonts/*`, motion lint test | T4 | drift test; 0 hex outside `tokens.css`; lint passes |
| T6 | `lib/api.ts`: `getAuthToken()` (`pw_token`), `stepUp()` single point, typed envelopes, 401/503 routing; replace React Query hooks with plain hooks (+ `lib/cache.ts` only if a screen needs it — report must justify); delete `pw_prefs` localStorage | T4 | Vitest error mapping; grep: `import.meta.env` only `VITE_API_URL`; no `@tanstack` import |
| T7 | Primitives A: `Dialog`, `Popover`, `LiveRegion` + tests | T5 | axe 0; keyboard tests; batching test (3 → 1 merged) |
| T8 | Primitives B: `Drawer`, `Disclosure`, `StatusChip`, `CompanionSlot` (sibling artwork/trigger per §5), `StepUpPrompt` + tests | T7 | axe 0; StatusChip luminance-only; CompanionSlot: trigger is in the a11y tree, artwork is not, companion-off keeps trigger |
| T9 | `AppShell`, `SectionNav` from `/api/sections` (hidden sections omitted from nav, routes still resolve), responsive cascade, skip link, landmarks, `EmptyState`/`ErrorState`, prefs → `<html data-pw-*>` before content | T1, T8 | §8 browser gates on empty-state build of all 9 routes |
| T10 | Screens I: Today (rows 1–3), Journal (4), Vault (5) | T9 | rows 1–5 |
| T11 | Screens II: Settings — prefs from schema, companion, reminders, capability table, **Sections panel** (Move up/down, Hide/Show buttons, no drag; "Restore default sections") | T9 | row 6; reorder + hide `today` persists across reload; `settings` shows no Hide control |
| T12 | Screens III: `ChatPanel` + transitional Chat route (7); Login (9); single SetupWizard (8) | T9 | rows 7–9 |
| T13 | Section stubs: Interests, Media, Projects, Lab (Lab = real table; others honest `EmptyState` naming the capability) | T9 | axe; empty-state copy test (no mount paths) |
| T14 | Fake-data purge (15), no-external test (16), bundle size + dist secret scan (17), zoom proxies (18a/b) | T10–T13 | rows 15–18 automated parts |
| T15 | Parity run + cutover: default `react`; delete four HTML constants, `/setup*`, `/login` server routes, dead JS; retire listed tests; docs (`OPERATIONS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN-HANDOFF.md` scope note, `RESPONSIVE_RULES.md` if the cascade changed) | T14 + **HUMAN row 18** | full checklist green in CI; `api.py` loses the inline HTML; suite green |
| T16 | Reconcile `.agent/STATE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, completion plan P1 complete | T15 | `test_docs` |

## 11. Acceptance tests (what proves P1 done)

- Backend: `tests/test_sections.py`, updated `tests/test_prefs.py`,
  `tests/test_frontend_serving.py`, `tests/test_dist_safety.py` (skips
  locally without a build; required in CI).
- Frontend: Vitest per primitive (+axe); `tokens.spec`, `no-hex.spec`,
  `motion-lint.spec`, `no-fake-strings.spec`, `api-errors.spec`.
- Browser: `frontend/e2e/*.spec.ts` = checklist rows 1–17 and the two
  zoom proxies, across four viewports.
- Human: row 18 real 200% zoom on the deployed build; one walk of rows
  1–9 by the owner. Both recorded in T15's truth report.

## 12. Open decisions

None for P1. The only open decision in the programme remains the calendar
provider (completion plan Part G).
