"""agent-sync project-status sensor for Project Worlds.

Consumes the read-only `agent-sync status --all --format json`
observation of Rylee's project estate and presents it as Project
Worlds' project-status truth. agent-sync (the pickle project's
adapter layer) stays AUTHORITATIVE for repository publication
state: this module invokes the tool, parses its documented
`play-nice/repo-status-v1` JSON schema, and normalizes it into
Project Worlds' internal read-only model. It never calls Git
directly, never re-implements agent-sync's computation, and never
mutates a repository — status observes, presentation presents.

There must NOT be a second Git-state implementation inside
Project Worlds. Git owns Git truth; agent-sync interprets
project/repository state; Project Worlds consumes and presents
that interpretation.

Failure model (all honest, none fatal):
  - command absent   -> 'unavailable'; Project Worlds continues
  - timeout          -> 'unavailable' (bounded; no request hangs)
  - malformed JSON   -> 'unavailable'; records are never partially
                        invented from a bad payload
  - one bad project  -> agent-sync itself isolates per-repo
                        failure into an `error` record; other
                        records survive and the bad one is kept
                        with its honest error text
  - remote unknown   -> safe_to_leave='unknown' is PRESERVED,
                        never converted to healthy or unhealthy

Exit-code semantics (from agent_status.py cmd_status): exit 0 =
all settled; exit 1 = valid observation but some project needs
attention ("work to do" signal, NOT a provider failure — the JSON
is still complete and honest); exit 2 = no projects found. Only
non-zero-and-unparseable output is a provider failure.

Cache: none. agent-sync owns computation; every call is a fresh
dated observation carrying `observed_at`. The caller may cache a
dated result for responsiveness; a cached result must stay visibly
an observation, never timeless truth.
