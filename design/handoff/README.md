# design/handoff/ — archived design spec package

The original Personal World 0.1 design handoff (GitHub `burgeswe/personal-world`
commit `aa3f6d8`, 2026-09-06). Preserved verbatim as historical/reference
material; commit IDs predate the 2026-09-07 history sanitization and were
remapped to their rewritten equivalents.

Canonical status, per the operator's 2026-09-06 decision: the **most recent Figma
export** (see `../exports/0.1/`) and the spec package it corresponds to are
the canonical visual source. Where this archive's `DESIGN_TOKENS.json`
disagrees with `../tokens.json`, this archive reflects the canonical palette
direction (aubergine `#0a0810`/`#12101a`, teal `#72b1b1`, rose `#b57f8b`);
`../tokens.json` is the repo-owned token file implementations consume and was
reconciled to that palette in the same integration.

Do not edit files here to change design truth — update `../tokens.json` and
`docs/DESIGN-HANDOFF.md`, then re-derive.
2026-09-07: the four canonical accessibility documents that once lived
here (ACCESSIBILITY_CONTRACT.md, SCREEN_READER_WALKTHROUGH.md,
RESPONSIVE_RULES.md, PREFERENCES_SCHEMA.json) moved to
`docs/accessibility/` so the canonical authority no longer sits inside
an archived directory. This directory is now purely the historical 0.1
spec package.
