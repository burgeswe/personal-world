        Project Worlds is direction-driven, not backlog-driven — see the
        [roadmap](https://github.com/burgeswe/personal-world/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).
        Ideas that fit the core invariant (capabilities core-owned, providers
        optional) land faster than ones that add mandatory dependencies.
