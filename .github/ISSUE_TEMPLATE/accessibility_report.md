        Accessibility is a core contract of this project, not an
        afterthought — reports like this one are how it stays true.
        The contract lives in
        [ACCESSIBILITY_CONTRACT.md](https://github.com/Rylee-Bee/personal-world/blob/main/docs/accessibility/ACCESSIBILITY_CONTRACT.md).
        Do not include secrets or personal data.
